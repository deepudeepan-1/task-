DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1  VS   HTTP2




HTTP stands for  HyperText Transfer Protocol
 
The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser.
 
 
The difference between http1.1 and http2 is HTTP/2 is faster in terms of performance and site loading time than HTTP1.
 
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

HTTP1. x used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles. ... Browsers using HTTP/2 implementation will convert the same text commands into binary before transmitting it over the network.
